While headaches are often caused by things like stress, dehydration, or lack of sleep, persistent or severe headaches should be evaluated. Have you noticed any specific patterns, such as when they occur or anything that makes them worse? If the headaches are frequent, very painful, or accompanied by other symptoms like vision changes, nausea, or confusion, I strongly recommend seeing a doctor to rule out any underlying issues."

A normal body temperature is typically around 98.6°F (37°C), but it can vary slightly. If your fever is mild, staying hydrated, resting, and taking over-the-counter fever reducers like acetaminophen can help. However, if your temperature is above 102°F (38.9°C) or you’re experiencing other symptoms like difficulty breathing, a rash, or severe discomfort, you should seek medical attention right away."
